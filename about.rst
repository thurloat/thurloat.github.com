About Me
========

Hi, I'm Adam Thurlow; A 24 year old software engineer living in Halifax,
NS. I am an ardent programmer, I have a passion for learning new
technologies and frameworks, and I do my best to evangelize the
technologies that I believe in. Speaking of which, you can always catch
me talking about how great and terrible Google App Engine is, how powerful and
magical Django is, and how kick-ass javascript is -- Vanilla JS, Coffeescript,
or GWT. 

I spend most of my coding time in `TextMate`_ for Python and JS or `Eclipse`_ 
for GWT / Android development. I go by *"Thurloat"* online, that's my twitter 
handle -- well heck, my *everything* handle. I'm very reachable via twitter, 
so @ me, and I'll reply. 

When not programming, I like to learn more about programming. In the off chance 
that I'm doing something not programming or hygiene related, You'll find me 
drinking a cup of `fine`_ local coffee, catching up on the latest tech news, 
listening to rock music, eating `sushi`_. I work / live at `SheepDogInc.ca`_ and
I love my Job. My loosey goosey title is "Software Engineer", I spend most of my 
time focusing on crazy RnD projects, OpenSocial Gadgets, and Django
applications.

I'm a huge fan of Open Source Software. As much as I love the idea, I love
contributing. Some of my favourite projects to donate my time to are
ControlFreak chrome extension, Socrates static site generator (Jekyll for
python), and occasionally THIS OTHER THING TOO.
