:title: About

Hi, I'm Adam Thurlow; A 26 year old software engineer living in Halifax,
Nova Scotia. I am an ardent programmer, I have a passion for learning new
technology, and I do my best to evangelize the ones that I believe in. 
Speaking of which, you can always catch me talking about how great and 
terrible Google App Engine is, how powerful and magical Django is, 
and how kick-ass javascript is -- Vanilla JS, Coffeescript,
or GWT. 

I spend most of my coding time in a myriad of different IDEs / Editors. 
The flavours of the week seems to be some combination of PyCharm, vim and
Eclipse depending on what I'm writing. I go by *"Thurloat"* online, that's my twitter 
handle -- well heck, my *everything* handle. I'm very reachable via twitter, 
so @ me, and I'll reply. 

When not programming, I like to learn more about programming. In the off chance 
that I'm doing something not programming or hygiene related, You'll find me 
drinking a cup of `fine`_ local coffee, catching up on the latest tech news, 
listening to rock music, or eating `sushi`_. I work / live at `SheepDogInc.ca`_ and
I love my Job. My loosey goosey title is "Software Engineer", I spend most of my 
time focusing on crazy RnD projects, consulting on bleeding edge tech, and Django
applications.

I'm a huge fan of Open Source Software. As much as I love the idea, I love
contributing. Some of my favourite projects to donate my time to are
ControlFreak chrome extension, Socrates static site generator (Jekyll for
python), and whichever project I fork to fix a bug on.

Me, Elsewhere
=============

Here's a collection of things I've written that don't appear on my
website. 

Guest Posts
-----------

- Google App Engine Blog - `Agile Paddling with App Engine`_
   
  I was asked to write a guest post on behalf of Norex as sort of a
  testimonial and case study of our involvement with the World Canoe
  Championships 2009 and Google App Engine.
- Norex.ca Blog - `The Olympics Of Programming 2010`_
- Norex.ca Blog - `Monkey Patching`_ : Friend or Foe

Tutorials
---------

- Dashboard Framework - `Chunk Versions`_ :: Advanced
  A sort of throw-it-in-your-face introduction to the concept of Chunk
  Versions in the Dashboard Framework (advanced concept, made easy)
   
Projects & Codes
================

These are some of the projects i'm working on or am involved in. This is
also a place where I keep links to useful snippets of code that I want
to share.

Google Closure Linter TextMate Bundle
-------------------------------------

A TextMate Bundle created out of necessity to streamline my workflow
using the excellent Closure Utilities. It encapsulates both the Linter
output in a nice TextMate HTML Output window, and the fixjsstyle utility
to make those quick style changes.

GistRSS
-------

A fun little GitHub Gist RSS feed maker. This grew out of a want to
condense the sites I visit each day. I can now prettily follow Gists in
my Google Reader. Feel free to make use of it if you can.

GSUtil (branch)
---------------

Since the release
of Google Storage for Developers, I've seen the need to expand on the
current toolset that Google is providing for migrating data. Including
adding options for custom headers, gzipping the file contents and
settings ACLS right from the copy command.

NOTE:
~~~~~
As of June 16th 2010 my code has been merged into the official
GSUtil project (svn diff http://goo.gl/0K9g ), they
chose not to pull in gzip, so I'll re-implement my gzip into the latest
gsutil version later this week

NOTE2:
~~~~~~
As of July 2nd,
the gzip functionality has been pulled into trunk, and passed code
review within Google. So unless I come up with some other features, I'll
just keep this around for historical purposes :)
