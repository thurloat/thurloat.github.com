So, here I was (you are here). Sitting on the couch, leisurely watching
“John and Kate plus 8”. When I looked over at Jessica’s Psychology Quiz.
This text is quoted straight from an University Psych textbook... seriously.

    If Captain Picard leaves Deep Space Nine at 0900 hours and travels at
    Warp 4 his shuttlecraft, he can rendezvous with the Starship
    Enterprise in 4. 2 hours. However, in order to reach the ship so
    quickly, he would have to travel through the Neutral Zone, and his
    presence would undoubtedly be noticed by Romulan warships, which would
    attack and destroy his craft. Thus, Picard realizes that he will have
    to take another route to the ship and thus devises what comes to be
    known as the “Picard loop” to get around the neutral zone. The Captain
    has applied ____. 
        
        A) crystallized intelligence ability 
        B) an algorithm 
        C) deductive reasoning skill 
        D) means-ends analysis

My question is: 

Why is picard on Deep Space Nine?
