All of the Police activity around my apartment building is winding down,
and Police report was finally submitted to halifax.ca, but they don't
have permalinks for their reports so I thought I might just paste it
below for future reference.

Drug Charges
============

    *December 9, 2009* **Drug Search Results in Charges** Four men and one
    woman face charges after a drug search last night in Fairview by the
    HRP/RCMP Integrated Drug Unit assisted by the Quick Response Unit. A
    search of a residence in the 0-100 block of Dawn Street resulted in
    the seizure of a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, hash and other drug
    paraphernalia. A handgun magazine containing bullets was also seized.
    Five people were arrested at the scene without incident. Stephen
    Andrew Coleman, 21, of Dartmouth, is charged with drug trafficking and
    weapons related offences. He was also wanted on a parole warrant. Shea
    Alexander Durnford, 21, of Halifax, is charged with drug trafficking
    and also had an outstanding parole warrant. Ryan William Ross, 20, of
    Dartmouth, Ashley Rose MacNeil, 23, and Eric Thomas Whickens, 53, both
    of Halifax face charges of drug trafficking. Coleman, Durnford, Ross
    and MacNeil were all held for court today while Whickens was released
    but also scheduled to appear in court today.
