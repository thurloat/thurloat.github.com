:categories: Javascript, Testing, Phantom.js

Everyone and their *cat* knows that the test reporters in `Mocha`_ are much 
more nicely put together than those in `Jasmine`_. However, in the latest 
version of `Phantomjs`_ (1.7) there is a new `API`_ that allows Jasmine console
runners to catch up. I got tired of watching a slew of bland and illegible 
``console.log`` messages after every code change, so I went ahead and 
implemented the infamous `nyan reporter`_ that comes built into Mocha using the
new API methods.

The general approach is to have your test runner within the headless browser
make a call out to phantom with ``window.callPhantom`` and use it as a sort of
message bus to report progress within the test reporter. And within your
Phantom executed JavaScript, hook onto ``page.onCallback`` and pass some parameterized
objects around to notify Phantom of the child page's state.

Jasmine Reporter
----------------

Here's a stripped down version of what I have in place to do the console
reporting to help illustrate the new API methods. 

**new-console-jasmine-reporter.js**

.. code-block:: javascript

  NewConsoleReporter = function() { };
  NewConsoleReporter.prototype = {
    reportRunnerStarting: function(runner) {
      this.tellPhantom({"type":"init", "payload": runner.specs().length});
    },
    reportSpecResults: function(spec) {
      // ... collect the spec results
      this.tellPhantom({
        "type":"spec",
        "payload":{
          "didFail": spec.didFail,
          "suite": spec.suite.description,
          "description": spec.description,
          "numFailures": failures,
          "failureMessage": consoleFailure 
        }});
    },
    reportRunnerResults: function(runner) {
      this.out({"type":"results", "payload": {}});
    },
    tellPhantom: function(message) {
      if (window.callPhantom) {
        window.callPhantom(message);
      }
    }
  };
  jasmine.NewConsoleReporter = NewConsoleReporter;

This ``NewConsoleReporter`` object is structured to plug directly into Jasmine
using it's default reporter interface. You can create it the same way that you
would a normal ``HtmlReporter`` or ``JasmineXmlReporter`` with the Jasmine
environment. If you open the page in a browser, you're not going to see
anything at all, so let's move onto the Phantom implementation.

Phantom Runner
--------------

The phantom code is pretty simple as well once you distill out most of the 
``console.log`` hacks that I had to do in order to draw the cat, but a basic 
Phantom script that builds off the Jasmine reporter above would look something 
like the following.

**nyancat-jasmine-phantom.js**

.. code-block:: javascript

    var htmlrunner = phantom.args[0],
        page = require("webpage").create();
    var pwd = fs.workingDirectory;
  
    // supress all the stdout messages from the runner so our reporter looks
    // pretty even when tests fail. 
    page.onConsoleMessage = function(msg, source, linenumber) { };
    page.onError = function(msg, trace) { };

    // ascii control character to clear the screen so you can write fresh. 
    var cls = function() {return '\u001b[2J\u001b[1;3H';};
   
    // keep some state around how the test suite is doing for future reporting.
    var wins = 0,
      totalSpecs = 100,
      totalFailures = 0,
      failureMessages = [],
      cols = 80;
      
    // Here's the new `experimental` API.
    page.onCallback = function(callbackData){

      var pld = callbackData["payload"];

      switch(callbackData["type"]){
        case "init":
          totalSpecs = pld;
          break;
        case "spec":
          var output = cls();
          wins++;
          totalFailures += pld.numFailures;
          output += "Running Unit Tests\n";
           
          // draw the cat that poops rainbows ...

          if (pld.didFail) {
            failureMessages.push(pld.failureMessage);
          }

          output += "Running: " + wins + " of " + totalSpecs + ". Failures: " + totalFailures;
          console.log(output);
          break;
        case "results":
          // ugly setTimeouts are just to make sure slow computers flush stdout
          // before the phantom process exits.
          setTimeout(function(){
            // print out all of the test failures after the suite has finished
            // running
            if(totalFailures > 0){
              console.log("\033[1;31mFailures: " + stopColor);
              for(var i=0; i < failureMessages.length; ++i){
                console.log(failureMessages[i]);
              }
              setTimeout(function(){
                phantom.exit(totalFailures > 0 ? 1 : 0);
              }, 250);
            }
          }, 250);
          break;
      }
    };

    // Open phantom to the test runner. 
    page.open("file://localhost/" + pwd + "/" + htmlrunner, function(status) {
      if (status != "success") {
        console.log("phantomjs> Could not load '" + htmlrunner + "'.");
        phantom.exit(1);
      }
    });

Above you can see the ``page.onCallback`` event that gets fired when the child
page calls out with ``window.callPhantom`` and how it can be leveraged to make
more advanced (and realtime) test runners than what has been available with
projects like `phantomjs-jasminexml`_.

I sincerely hope that some motivated folks get on this bandwagon and create
some nice looking console test runners for Jasmine and Phantomjs. I am working on
cleaning up my Nyancat runner that I created as a more detailed starting point,
and if you need some motivation have a look at the `Mocha reporters`_ section 
of their documentation.

Good Luck!
