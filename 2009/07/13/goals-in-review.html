            <h1>Goals In Review</h1>
            <span class="date">Jul. 13, 2009</span> - Posted by Thurloat
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>It's about that time that I come out and see how my planned goals are
coming. I hate making excuses for not doing things, and it hurts me to
do so. So here's a long list of excuses.</p>
<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Whether or not anyone has heard, my father passed away from complications
with chemotherapy on July 3rd, 2010. Sparing all of the emotional outcry,
it's thrown a wrench into my plans and put me out of commission for a
week or two. I won't say that I haven't made ANY progress, as a couple
goals are in the double digit completion range. Here's the breakdown.</p>
<div class="section" id="contribute-something-good-to-an-open-source-project">
<h3>Contribute something good to an Open Source project</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>0%</strong>. Sadly I haven't had any time to work on personal projects
/ scour github for fun code to do stuff with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-up-with-at-least-1-of-the-micro-startup-idea">
<h3>Follow up with at least 1 of the micro-startup idea</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>15%</strong>. I've actually had a few minutes to think about this, so I
determined that any decision is a good one. So I started investigating
the isdanecookinthismovie.com idea. Haven't gone any further than doing
some proof of concept iMDB apps, but the ball IS rolling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="break-the-100-twitter-followers-barrier-real-125">
<h3>Break the 100 Twitter Followers barrier (real 125)</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>~75%</strong>. At the time of writing, my twitter counter reads 119
followers. I'm surprised at this growth, as I've really been
slacking lately in good tweets / anything not involving my father or his
funeral. It's amazing how supportive even people I know only on twitter
can be. Thanks everyone, and I promise that I'll bring more fun and
geeky goodness again soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-on-our-wedding-rsvp-website">
<h3>Work on our Wedding &amp; RSVP website</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>5%</strong>. Again, Sadly this has been put on the side recently with
all of this commotion going about. I've been thinking about it some and
I am aiming to begin having some fun programming this on Tuesday. At
LEAST 2 hours. Signed and Verified by me, even entered into my Google
Calendar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finish-2-paintings">
<h3>Finish 2 Paintings</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>0%</strong>. Just getting back on my feet this week, this one I seem to
be having the more difficulty justifying spending extra time on. I hate
putting it off, but this month is super crammed. I'm going to revise
this goal to be a more reasonable 1 painting. (either half of my huge
canvas painting, or a start to finish smaller one).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finish-my-mothers-website">
<h3>Finish my Motherâ€™s Website</h3>
<p>Verdict : <strong>0%</strong>. Considering both my Mother and I have been disposed of for
the last week, I don't think that she'll be ready to work on this one in
the short term, so I don't expect to start on this one until at least
the end of the month.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lose-15-pounds">
<h3>Lose 15 pounds</h3>
<p>Verdict : 5%. I could have worked on this while I was in Parrsboro, but
I just couldn't find the energy. So I started last night again, with a
regime that is sure to help me out in this department. I haven't lost
any more than what could just be day-to-day weight fluctuation so it's
not even worth reporting on. (however my new jeans seem to just barely
now require a belt)</p>
<p>This is not the outcome I was hoping for, but I did make some effort in
a few of these goals. and I've revised a few of them to make them more
realistic in the time frame that I have left.</p>
