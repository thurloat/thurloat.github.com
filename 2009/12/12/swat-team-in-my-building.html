            <p>All of the Police activity around my apartment building is winding down,
and Police report was finally submitted to halifax.ca, but they don't
have permalinks for their reports so I thought I might just paste it
below for future reference.</p>

<h2>Drug Charges</h2>
<blockquote>
<em>December 9, 2009</em> <strong>Drug Search Results in Charges</strong> Four men and one
woman face charges after a drug search last night in Fairview by the
HRP/RCMP Integrated Drug Unit assisted by the Quick Response Unit. A
search of a residence in the 0-100 block of Dawn Street resulted in
the seizure of a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, hash and other drug
paraphernalia. A handgun magazine containing bullets was also seized.
Five people were arrested at the scene without incident. Stephen
Andrew Coleman, 21, of Dartmouth, is charged with drug trafficking and
weapons related offences. He was also wanted on a parole warrant. Shea
Alexander Durnford, 21, of Halifax, is charged with drug trafficking
and also had an outstanding parole warrant. Ryan William Ross, 20, of
Dartmouth, Ashley Rose MacNeil, 23, and Eric Thomas Whickens, 53, both
of Halifax face charges of drug trafficking. Coleman, Durnford, Ross
and MacNeil were all held for court today while Whickens was released
but also scheduled to appear in court today.</blockquote>
