            <p>So, here I was (you are here). Sitting on the couch, leisurely watching

<p>If Captain Picard leaves Deep Space Nine at 0900 hours and travels at
Warp 4 his shuttlecraft, he can rendezvous with the Starship
Enterprise in 4. 2 hours. However, in order to reach the ship so
quickly, he would have to travel through the Neutral Zone, and his
presence would undoubtedly be noticed by Romulan warships, which would
attack and destroy his craft. Thus, Picard realizes that he will have

known as the “Picard loop” to get around the neutral zone. The Captain
has applied ____.</p>

<li>crystallized intelligence ability</li>
<li>an algorithm</li>
<li>deductive reasoning skill</li>
<li>means-ends analysis</li>
</ol>
