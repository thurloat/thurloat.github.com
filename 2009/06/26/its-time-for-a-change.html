        <section>
            <p>I had a good chat with Jessica the other day about my work load, the
things I say I will do, things promise I will do, priorities, and life
decisions. She always gets me into a thought provoking mood. It turns out
that I have made it a habit for myself to tell everyone <strong>YES</strong>! to
whatever they're asking ... then attempt to cram it into my schedule.
It's been pointed out to me that if I somehow don't get these things fit
into my schedule... I appear un-reliable. eek. So there are 2 action
items that I've decided I <strong>NEED</strong> to take. I need to start telling
people that I'm busy, and I need to come up with some clear goals that I
am going to work on. So I've decided that in order to build
motivation I need a list! I've always been inspired by
<a class="reference external" href="http://metaatem.net/">Erik Kastner's Blog</a> posts about his goals and I think
that writing them down and making it permanent will help make it happen.
I have a reputation to uphold, you know!</p>
<div class="section" id="this-month-s-goals">
<h2>This Month's Goals</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Write this post.</li>
<li>Contribute something good to an Open Source project.</li>
<li>Follow up with at least 1 idea.</li>
<li>Break 100 twitter followers.</li>
<li>Work on our Wedding &amp; RSVP web page.</li>
<li>Finish 2 paintings.</li>
<li>Finish my mother's website.</li>
<li>Lose 15 pounds.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="write-this-post">
<h3>Write this Post!</h3>
<p>...and more more after this</p>
<p>I've had this post stored in a text file on my computer for about a
month. It <em>NEEDS</em> to be written out, and followed through with. So in
completing this post, goal number 1 should be adequately sufficed!!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contribute-something-good-to-an-open-source-project">
<h3>Contribute something good to an Open Source project</h3>
<div class="floatright container">
<img alt="Open Source&quot;" src="http://thurloat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/16631508_3588891393_m.jpg" />
</div>
<p>This has always been one of my goals. I know that I contribute to the
Dashboard Framework almost daily, but that doesn't count. I'm talking
big time project, small time grunt work. I've been using this software
and giving them a pat on the back, saying it's great, reporting bugs
etc. I need to give back to the community that I am continuously taking
from. It's the nature of it all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-up-with-at-least-1-idea">
<h3>Follow up with at least 1 idea</h3>
<p>I've come up with so many great little web ideas over the past
year or so that i no longer know which ones are good / feasible /
possible. I'm going to try to whittle it down to 1 for this month and
attempt to get the ball rolling. Even if it is as little
as*IsDaneCookInThisMovie.com*, it's still a tiny step in the right
direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="break-the-100-twitter-followers-barrier">
<h3>Break the 100 Twitter Followers barrier</h3>
<p>They say that you don't get the full experience of twitter until you
have at least 100 followers. So I really want to experience the full
effect of this social network.</p>
<p><strong>update</strong> This happened yesterday. I've reached 100. So i guess i'll
aim for 125 by this time next month!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-on-our-wedding-rsvp-website">
<h3>Work on our Wedding &amp; RSVP website</h3>
<p>This is something very important to both Jessica and I. I've been saying
that I'll work on it as soon as i get some time. All I need to do is set
some time aside for this, and without design, the programming shouldn't
take more than an hour or 2. (design help is very welcome -- thurloat at
gmail dot com <em>wink</em>)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finish-2-paintings">
<h3>Finish 2 Paintings</h3>
<p>I have 2 paintings on the go right now, and they always take the back
seat to other projects. It's something I really enjoy, and something
that I can connect with Jessica on. I started a huge one around
Christmas for her and I still haven't passed the pencil-on-canvas stage.
This won't be an easy one to fit in, but if I can hold off on doing
other things, I know I can find time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finish-my-mother-s-website">
<h3>Finish my Mother's Website</h3>
<p>So my Mum started her own cloth diaper business last year and I've been
promising all along that I would make her a website for it, and help her
with online marketing for it, etc. I can usually only seem to find 20 or
30 minutes at a time and I'm stuck at about 85% on this one, I just need
a little boot in the arse to complete it. The only reason it's on here
is to make sure that I get it done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lose-15-pounds">
<h3>Lose 15 pounds</h3>
<div class="floatleft container">
<img alt="Scale" src="http://thurloat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2327303872_dc82c30d71_t.jpg" />
</div>
<p>I know this goal sounds un-reasonable, but I know I have the power to do
it myself, and they say the first few pounds come off really quickly.
I'm not expecting this sort of weight loss to be linear. I just know
that if I put a ton of work in early, than I can see faster results
which will motivate me to continue. The muscle burn that I'm feeling
already is motivation so far, but the numbers do help.</p>
<p>So that's my list to complete over the next 30 days. I'm going to make
it a priority for this month to post a weekly check in with my goals to
make sure I'm following through with them. If you're noticing me
slacking on these goals, put me in line! This is extremely important to
me, and I hope you're all kind enough to help !!</p>
