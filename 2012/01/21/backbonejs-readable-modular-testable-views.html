        <section>
            <p>After more work with Backbone on projects at <a class="reference external" href="http://sheepdoginc.ca">Sheepdog</a>, we are starting
to develop a solid foundation that will allow us to easily develop,
<strong>test</strong>, and maintain our Backbone.js applications. Having these properties in
our JS / CoffeeScript is very important, as we're striving toward better test
coverage from server to client in order to best deliver the highest quality
product to our clients.</p>
<p>The approach that I'm taking to solve our problem is a simple implementation
of two common design patterns found in MVP applications. The Observer Pattern,
and the Factory Pattern.</p>
<div class="section" id="i-observer">
<h2>I, Observer</h2>
<p>Obtaining much of my MVP knowledge from one of our products written in GWT
(<a class="reference external" href="http://gtraxapp.com/">gTrax</a>) using the awesome GWT-Presenter and EventBus
libraries, it's been ingrained into my being that all independant pieces of
the application should  communicate exclusively over an agreed-upon API.
Rather than touting the benefits of modular code, I'll assume that since you're
still reading this you understand.</p>
<p>EventBus helps consolidate communication while developing in java and GWT,
and I didn't have to look far to find a flexible solution already available.
Backbone already mixes in the <strong>Backbone.Events</strong> class into all core pieces
of the framework so it's the perfect candidate (<em>shaving a yak, and all that</em>).
While I've seen this pattern implemented a few times, at <a class="reference external" href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/07/19/references-routing-and-the-event-aggregator-coordinating-views-in-backbone-js/">Los Techies</a> most
notably, it has been missing a key piece of the puzzle. Either people are
binding an instance of <strong>Backbone.Events</strong> directly to the window, and operate
using that, or manually pass an instance of it to each vew they create. I have
two main problems with these methods which I'll outline in my review of the
following code example.</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>My first problem with the above code is that it doesn't follow the IMO
&quot;Awesomeness&quot; that is Backbone.js style. I am of the opinion that one of the
best parts of Backbone is how they suggest you structure your View classes.
To me it is immediately obvious that, in the above class declaration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The View will render in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></tt>.</li>
<li>It respondes to a click event on the <tt class="docutils literal">.close_button</tt> class.</li>
<li>It watches for changes on any form inputs, then calls <tt class="docutils literal">formChanged</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a key piece of information is being tucked away in <tt class="docutils literal">MyView</tt>'s
declaration. It registers its most important event <tt class="docutils literal">globalEvent</tt> which
gets exposed via the global eventBus. It should be a first class citizen
along with <tt class="docutils literal">events</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">tagName</tt> which clearly outlines how the View
will behave.</p>
<p>The second problem I have with the above code is that you're required in your
implementation to create your own instance of <strong>Backbone.Events</strong> and pass
it to each view you want to create, anywhere in the application. This isn't
the <strong>worst</strong> thing, however, what happens when your views have 2 dependancies?
3? 4? ...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-f-tories">
<h2>Enter F%#tories</h2>
<p>So many programmers cringe when they hear the word <strong>Factory</strong>. Factory,
factory, factory, factory. Now that you've said it 5 times it just sounds
silly and we can talk about them seriously and without cringing.</p>
<p>This following ViewFactory solves the second problem that I had with our
initial introduction to the Observer pattern above, and I'll address the first
and most serious problem a little later.</p>

</td></tr></table><p>In 10 lines of coffeescript, I've shown how you can have a simple factory that
is useful in a few key ways that are adventageous for structuring a large
Backbone.js application.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It will automatically bind the eventBus (Observer) object to any class
we create.</li>
<li>It has a registry that will bolt onto Backbone's <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;options</tt> for any View
built using the factory for when your views become more complext and require
additional dependancies.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="the-final-countdown">
<h2>The Final Countdown</h2>
<p>Now you're ready for the good stuff. Using the <tt class="docutils literal">ViewFactory</tt> we can guarantee
that our views will be built with the dependencies injected, and use it to
build a class that looks like this.</p>

</td></tr></table><p>Notice 2 big changes to the <tt class="docutils literal">MyView</tt> class that I've defined in awesome.coffee.
It now extends <tt class="docutils literal">ModularView</tt>, which I'll link to at the end, and it's
<strong>immediately</strong> obvious what the API for this View looks like after promoting
<tt class="docutils literal">globalEvents</tt> to being a first class citizen. The outcome? we just blew the
readability, modularity, and testability of <tt class="docutils literal">MyView</tt> out of the water.</p>
<div class="section" id="readability">
<h3>Readability</h3>
<p>Any new developer that needs to know how your View responds to global events
simply needs to look right at the top of your declaration for <tt class="docutils literal">globalEvents</tt>
to see which ones the View has registered. This has already improved the workflow
on our team by reducing confusion, as well as getting rid of horrid documentation
in favour of people actually understanding what the View is supposed to to
simply by reading the code.</p>

<div class="section" id="modularity">
<h3>Modularity</h3>
<p>Two months down the road, you might want to implement an alternate view that
works on the same API. An example is starting with implementing an edit form,
and later on, it becomes a requirement to have additionally, a compact /
simplified view to do the same operation. Better still you want to create a
read-only view who should still respond in the same manner as the edit form,
but display and act in a totally different way.</p>
<p>Using <tt class="docutils literal">ModularView</tt>, any programmer just needs to look over the
<tt class="docutils literal">globalEvents</tt> declaration of the initial view, and ensure their new view can
respond to these same events. This makes it possible to swap out any view in
your application ensuring that you're not forgetting pieces, or creating
new bugs in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testability">
<h3>Testability</h3>
<p>This is one of the more exciting benefits of using <tt class="docutils literal">globalEvents</tt> for me. Now,
rather than writing tests that depend on other views you only need to test the
interface that the View needs. If you're doing BDD with tools like
<a class="reference external" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">jasmine</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://sinonjs.org/">sinon.js</a>, you can write your new View's test suite first based
on the agreed upon <tt class="docutils literal">globalEvents</tt> interface that has been defined.</p>

badass Views in Backbone. If you're interested in seeing how the ModularView
is implemented, I created it as a gist on GitHub:
<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/1655106">https://gist.github.com/1655106</a> . There's a Docstring on the class with a more
condense example.</p>
