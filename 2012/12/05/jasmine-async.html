    <p>I'll start out by saying that I'm a huge <a class="reference external" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> fan. I have been
working with it exclusively for testing during the last few months. However,
it has become common knowledge that Jasmine's built-in methods for testing async
code are pretty weak and make for either lots of boilerplate, or fragile tests.</p>
<p>Let's go on a journey together from a small greenfield test suite through to
a full(<em>er</em>) set of specs as the project grows. I will walk through how I came
to implement a jasmine test extension for simplifying asynchronous specs
which I believe is a more holistic approach than I've seen anywhere else.</p>
<p>The few key differences you should note about the final solution are that it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allows for fail-fast tests without breaking the <tt class="docutils literal">waitsFor</tt> callback when an
exception is thrown,</li>
<li>Provides a simple mechanism to wrap async methods so their exceptions are
caught and reported correctly,</li>
<li>Doesn't require any different syntax than a Jasminaut is used to (less
refactoring).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="affairs">
<h2>Affairs</h2>
<p>I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/2012/07/06/jasmine-swallowing-async-exceptions">post</a> a few months ago which, at the time, dealt with my
asynchronous woes enough to keep me going. To quickly re-cap check out the
small snippet below.</p>

</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>As you can see, I am now executing the callback function as part of a jasmine
<tt class="docutils literal">runs()</tt> block. This causes the test to run the callback within the
scope of the jasmine environment, thus being able to report on the failed
specs. This solution worked for me for a while until I needed to write some
integration tests for a complex data controller. This process allowed me to find
find a weakness in the <tt class="docutils literal">runs</tt> method: if the callback is never called the
test <strong>will pass anyway</strong> -- false positives make it tough to track down
problems, and reduce your confidence in the suite, making you test less,
pushing you to break your software.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the solution was to implement an <tt class="docutils literal">itMust</tt> method for
Jasmine. This provides a <tt class="docutils literal">complete</tt> argument to the spec which it must call in
order for the test to pass. Here's the runner, and a sample of what the specs
look like with <tt class="docutils literal">itMust</tt> in use.</p>

</td></tr></table><p>From here I was able to build out the test suite for the data controller without
running into too much trouble. However, it still required that you use the
<tt class="docutils literal">runs()</tt> block syntax on any asynchronous function, and leaving one out could
cause unfortunate results. Again, having tests pass when they should fail makes
the test suite useless. It was time to look into extending or <em>replacing</em> this
testing solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examining-the-options">
<h2>Examining The Options</h2>
<p>After being frustrated by my situation, I stumbled across <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/derickbailey">Derick Bailey's</a>
solution: <a class="reference external" href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/08/18/jasmine-async-making-asynchronous-testing-with-jasmine-suck-less/">Jasmine.Async</a>. He tries to solve this problem in the suite with a
new optional testing object called <tt class="docutils literal">AsyncSpec</tt>. In a nutshell, his approach
was to instantiate an <tt class="docutils literal">AsyncSpec</tt> object for each test and wrap the spec in
a <tt class="docutils literal">waitsFor</tt> -&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">runs</tt> sequence that causes the spec to stall until the
callback is called -- then allows it to continue on to the next jasmine block.</p>
<p>I had a few problems with this solution which enticed me to create a new/better
one which is loosely based on Derick's approach <strong>and</strong> works for me. The
biggest pain points for me with Jasmine.Async were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I had to re-write all of my tests to use his approach of wrapping async
actions in the <tt class="docutils literal">beforeEach</tt> function,</li>
<li>It introduced a new <tt class="docutils literal">AsyncSpec</tt> object that I didn't want to have to
instantiate for all of the specs, thus creating additional boilerplate,</li>
<li>And when a test failed, it would wait the full 5000ms timeout that
<tt class="docutils literal">waitsFor</tt> defaults to before a test failed if the <tt class="docutils literal">done</tt> callback was
never fired.</li>
</ul>
<p>This slowed testing to a crawl because running a failing test
suite went from taking 1 second, up to (5x + 1)s. This can take
entire minutes in some cases.</p>
<p>Further information on why slow tests are bad, and good testing in general:
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/05/24/TDDTestSuitesShouldRunIn10SecondsOrLess.aspx">Mark Seemann</a> &amp;&amp; <a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/video/631/fast-test-slow-test">Gary Bernhardt</a></p>
<p>The other option which many have suggested, is migrating tests over to
<a class="reference external" href="http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/">Mocha</a>. Since Mocha has async testing nailed down, not to mention some
really sexy test runners (<em>more on this in another blog post</em>). Switching testing
utilities at this point in the project wasn't really an option for me, as it
would require rewriting hundreds of specs, as well as all of the development
tools that compile the test runner and run them in <a class="reference external" href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a> (my headless
webkit of choice). If I were to greenfield a new project, this will definitely be a
project to look at, but some of us have to make the best with we have.</p>
<p>Without further adieu ...</p>

<div class="section" id="the-codes">
<h2>The Codes</h2>
<p>Now that the journey has been laid out, I'll share the destination as well. My
solution is (I believe) a more natural approach to writing these specs than
other options allow.</p>

</td></tr></table><p>Now that's what I'm talking about -- looks just like a regular jasmine spec
should, no hacks or anything. Specs run and fail just as they should. It also
provides an <tt class="docutils literal">asyncBlock</tt> function generator that you can use to wrap a callback
the same way that the <tt class="docutils literal">runs()</tt> block does which will provide additional details
on exceptions that get thrown while the test gets run. Otherwise, exceptions
are reported generally and immediately.</p>
<p>Below, I have included my <cite>jasmine-async.coffee</cite> testing utility which is a
pruned version of what I am using in production so I can demonstrate the
simplest version possible. You can take the code below and run with it; hopefully
making your asynchronous testing a little smoother than it was before. &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/4199060">Gist</a>&gt;</p>
