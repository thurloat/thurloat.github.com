Lately, something that has been invading my tweets and really
interesting me, has been the news regarding Chrysler and the General
Motors (GM) bankruptcies. Keeping tabs on the auto industry is a odd
hobby of mine. You’d like me to fill you in on the confusion of it all?
SURE!

So from what i’ve gathered, the situation as it stands on The Big Three
(Ford, Chrysler and General Motors) is as follows:

-   Chrysler is so bankrupt it isn’t even funny. They are selling off
    all of their semi-profitable brands to other companies and seeking
    buy-outs from foreign markets.

-   GM has also filed bankruptcy, but has put a wonderful Public
    Relations spin on the whole thing. IIRC the company is now 60% owned
    by the US government, and i’ve just recently heard that the Canadian
    Government has decided to invest \~ approximately $10 billion in the
    “restructuring” of the brand. They’ve decided to focus on only their
    core market. This means that Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC will
    be the only surviving GM brands, and they’re also looking on cutting
    down their expansive, self-competitive lineup to under 30 offerings
    across all brands.

-   Ford is on top of their game. No one has heard about Ford lately
    because they decided to restructure in 2006 before anyone else knew
    something was going wrong. See, back in 06’ when Ford got their new
    CEO, he did a massive “re-invention”. They have since brought back
    the Taurus (mistake to have killed it), are working on a global
    automobile platform, and keeping as economical as possible. Ford is
    expecting to actually have to INCREASE production in the second half
    of this year by about ten percent in all of this economic turmoil.

So that’s how I am seeing the big three right now, and somehow after a
few years ago, Ford has pulled off being the top dog (for now). They
seem slightly worried now that the gvt’ owns 60% of GM, that they will
no longer want to do business with them.

The Auto Industry is in a rediculous amount of trouble in North America
right now, and the way I see it, in less than 3 years Chrysler is going
to be history, the GM ‘upturn’ might finally swing around in 6 years,
and Ford will benefit greatly from taking the early damage from their
restructuring in 06’ and be the only one left of the big three who can
continue to sustainably innovate, build reliable automobiles, and still
have a large Reasearch and Development section for greener cars in the
future.

I think that the damage has been done to the other not-quite-as-big two,
and they’re going to have a very steep hill to climb in order to find
their way out of this hole. Especially since Ford is one step ahead.

To wrap up, I believe there is a quote that sums up this whole
situation:

> “If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.” - Confucius
