Installed the MASSIVE iPhone SDK this morning (5.8gb). So now the hard
part is done and I can start the easy part by brushing up on my
Objective-C and playing around with some test apps.

Something tells me that I’ll have a lot of fun with this.

Things to do today for this project: Set up a github repo, try to go
“hello world” all up in this piece
