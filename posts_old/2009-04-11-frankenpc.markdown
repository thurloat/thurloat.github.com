Today I took apart my gaming rig, whom hasn’t seen any action in at
least 4 months. And then I took my media center / file server apart and
decided to make one badass PC and sell the leftover parts.

Took most of the afternoon to decide which core components I should
stick with. I ended up keeping my AMD stuff for the reason that I can
change out my 5400+ Black Edition for a phenom x4. And when that road
comes along it should be an affordable one to cross.

So, parts I’m not keeping include : Intel c2d E6750 CPU Evga 680i
motherboard Corsair silent 450 watt power supply 4gb ADATA ddr2 ram
Server size aluminum case with plexi side ( this thing is huge ) 120gb
WD sata hd

More of the list to come……
