So last night in a fit of frustration, from not getting that TV Tuner
card working on my windows media centre computer. I went to town and
downloaded Ubuntu 9.04. I was impressed with all of the new fancy things
it had (faster load times, ext4, didn’t have to find new drivers for a
few things like i did last time [8.04], picked up my tv resolution first
go [unlike 8.04]) i was pleased…

until i noticed my mouse kept getting stuck in a window. If i would
click on any window (not including the menus), that element would
capture my mouses focus and no matter where else i clicked, it wouldn’t
let go. Occasionally, a right click would release it from that element,
but most of the time i would have to hard quit out of that application
for it to release my mouse.

Does anyone have a clue about this?
