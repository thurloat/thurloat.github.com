So I brushed off my old photoshop disk this evening to do some design
work for a website I’m working on in my spare time. Holy cow batman. I’m
rusty. It took me 45 minutes to do something I know I used to be able to
do in 5.

I have so many trains I need to be hopping on board with as of late.
What with the iPhone app, this design stuff, python and app engine,
dashboard documentation. I need to slow down before I take on more
things and get overwhelmed. As an aside I’m also rewriting my site on
the dashboard framework in the near future.

Too many things.
