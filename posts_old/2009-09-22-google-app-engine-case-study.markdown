Earlier this week I was presented with the opportunity to write a blog
post / case study for the Google App Engine Blog about how I leveraged
App Engine while developing the Canoe '09 results application. How could
I refuse such an honor? Well, I couldn't. So after some careful edits
from the guys over at Google, and the folks here at the Norex office, we
came up with an interesting piece about the Agility, Reliability and
Stability that we saw during the course of the event. True Story!

### Preview:

> "... we saw over 1,000,000 page views from 93 countries around the
> world, and experienced incredible stability and scalability from
> Google App Engine even when we were spiking 350 requests per second
> during the finals. It was a big win for Norex, and App Engine has
> proven itself to be a serious contender for developing scalable web
> applications. Thanks so much to the Google App Engine team for
> providing such an outstanding product!"

One thing I think may have been missing from the case study is the
notion of how great of a team we had working on the application. As much
as I did the bulk of the programming and behind the scenes work, It
wouldn't have gone anywhere without the:

-   Idea & Motivation (Julia Rivard)
-   Management who believed in the project (Brandon Kolybaba)
-   Development Help (David Wolfe & Chris Troup)
-   Thorough Testing (Anas Trabulsi)
-   Human Power (Mark Jamieson)
-   Designer (Justin Bellefontaine)
-   My Fiancee (Jessica Sloan) - for putting up with my LONG nights
    during the event!

Thanks Guys! Here's a little screencast I put together of the iPhone
interface in action that didn't really fit into the discussion, but I'll
share it anyways: Link to the full case study from
