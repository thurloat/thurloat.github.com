I just got my mitts on Google Chrome for Mac. The JS speed is
incredible.

There is actually a visually noticeable speed difference when using our
Framework back![Google Chrome

I might just start using it for adminning sites / content entering
because it doesn’t ever bog down on the heavy JS loads for Chunk
revisions. It just seems to be more snappy in general compared to FF
3.01 where on many occasions will freeze up for 1/4 of a second when
it’s processing JS / finishing a page load that creates a frustration
inside of me so deep and burning…

… seriously. it’s only quarter of a second. but if i had all of those
1/4 seconds back, i’d for sure have at least a minute on my hands.

P.S. i just noticed that half of the toolbar for making tumblr posts has
dissapeared in chrome.. weird.
