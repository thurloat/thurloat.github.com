Today, i did a few updates to the AT1pc website. I added content to the
In-shop and On-site pages, they still have to be edited and formatted,
but the bigger part of my time was spent compiling the "[Free
Software](http://at1pc.com/freeapps.php)" page. I think it turned out
alright, once i get Photoshop installed back on to my computer i'll be
able to make the images myself, and they won't look so grainy (i
'borrowed' the images from other sites). On another note, i updated the
WP theme for this blog and plan to change it even more once i... wait a
sec, i already said this... once i install PHOTOSHOP!
