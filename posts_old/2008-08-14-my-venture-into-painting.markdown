![my painting](http://at1pc.com/upload/pics/IMG_5168.jpg)

So over the last week or so i’ve been sort of off the map. Out camping
in the woods with [Jess](http://twitter.com/jesssloan) and family
(**amazing** trip, i had such a blast), did lots of fishing, etc.

I also decided to put my hand to*painting*. If you gander to your left
you’ll see my first painting ever (**not** counting the turkeys that
were painted in elementry school :P) It’s called Chrisanthimum, not an
actual flower. I just came up with it in my head what it should look
like, lighting etc. It turned out a lot cooler than i thought it would.

I would like to thank my *wonderful* Jessica for being around when i had
any questions about technique (and for keeping me in line, not letting
me cheat by borrowing your ideas ;)). I couldn’t have pulled it off
without you.

Well, I’m pretty sure that i’ll be trying this out again at another
time, we’ll see what i decide to pain then. Until that time, ATL is out.
I have to get back to my TCL script, Jess’ website, and a**cool**new
site idea for Dad, which was all put on the back burner for almost a
week (***sorry*******guys)
