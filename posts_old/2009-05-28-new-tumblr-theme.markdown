I’m slowly working on getting together this Tumblr theme, it’s coming
along decently, and i have a ton of stuff i want to do with it! i’m
going to goto external JS city on this thing.

Either way, i’d like to know what everyone thinks of the fixed position
layout in the bottom. It’s not standard for sure, and it probably goes
against some sort of written ‘Design Code’, but golly, i like it.

That being said, i’m still working on it / tweaking it every evening a
little bit at a time. So hopefully it eveolved into something decent
looking.
