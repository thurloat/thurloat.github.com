So after **2** interviews, things are looking up :)

The first interview i had on Friday didn’t look too promising, lots of
Brain Teasers, which i didn’t do very well on *(nerves got to me*). Some
of the questions seemed a little odd, then again i felt **totally**
brain dead. he could have asked me what 6+3 was and i would have been
dead wrong.

Then the second one i had this afternoon was great! It was instead with
Chris (one of the lead devs). He was quite easy going and *very*
personable, after asking some questions and talking about he position,
he took me upstairs and introduced me to some of the dev team… out of
the corner of my eye, i spotted **RISK**. they play RISK during the work
day. how awesome is **that**?

Providing that i get the position, i get a new macbook pro (i’ve been
laptopless for ages now… poor Thurshiba. R.I.P.) perks! yay!

I’ll post again when i find out what’s up with the position.
