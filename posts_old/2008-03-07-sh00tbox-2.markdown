Well it looks like i finally found a use for the AJAX shoutbox i
developed in the fall. I’ve spend the past few days debugging it so it
would seemlessly integrate with Wordpress and there it is! If everyone
would please take a look to your right, you will see a pretty little
sh00tbox. Feel free to leave some messages. Also i’d like to thank Sonic
for helping me debug it (even though you didn’t actually do anything,
you were always there for me
