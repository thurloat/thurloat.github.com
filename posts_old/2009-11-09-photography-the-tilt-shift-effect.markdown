On a regular basis I find myself looking at something and thinking
"damnit, I wish i could keep this"... often times what I'm seeing in my
head isn't really what would be captured on film, my imagination is
often much less literal. That has been one of Photography's biggest
turn-offs for me in the past and hopefully this is where capturing and
editing skills from a few of my friends will keep me motivated!

With all this help, I'm sure that I'll be able to do some transferring
of 'vision'. That's what I like to call it anyway. So I've been playing
around with Photography more and more since I've inherited my Father's
Canon Digital Rebel XTi. I'll say that I'm having more fun than ever.
With the tips and tricks from my teachers it's really helping me to get
it on track. This week's experiment for me is the Tilt / Shift Effect.

With this example, I took a little extra time to mask out the taller
items, so they didn't blur out like the rest of the background, since
it's based on a z-index depth of field, items in that space need to
remain with the same amount of focus. If you'd like to try this out
yourself, here's the basic deal:

1.  Snap a photo: for a better effect, try to look down at about 45
    degrees.
2.  Open your new photo in Photoshop.
3.  Create a hue/saturation adjustment layer & crank up the saturation.
    This will help to harden the shadows and make it seem as if the
    light is a lot closer, as if your scene is within a diorama.
4.  Give your scene a layer mask and use the reflection gradient to draw
    a line through the focal point.
5.  Disable the layer mask, select your scene and goto Filter -\> Blur
    -\> Lens Blur...
6.  crank the radius up and tell it to use your layer mask for the blur.
7.  viola. you have a mini scene.

This is obviously a simplified set of steps, to complicate it further
you could adjust the light levels and draw your layer mask by hand, to
make sure you're not blurring things close that are in focus, but are
also tall. So I'm going to be keeping up with this whole photography
thing for the next little while and you should see a lot more posts of
this sort, if I can teach something while I'm learning -- Hurray for us!
