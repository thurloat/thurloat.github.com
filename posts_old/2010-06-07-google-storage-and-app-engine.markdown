I've been using [Google
Storage](http://code.google.com/apis/storage/) since I/O 2010, and I'm
impressed with it so far. At [SheepdogInc.ca](http://sheepdoginc.ca),
we've converted some of our application resources from using S3 over to
Google Storage this past week. 

Being early adopters has it's downfalls for sure; some of which usually
 include system instability, a lack of published tools, and proper / 
extensive documentation. I'll try to help address the latter in this 
short tutorial. Configuring Storage for App Engine has come up a couple of 
times in the Google Storage for Developers group... The biggest hurdle to 
overcome from looking at the Python Library Docs for GS
<[link](http://code.google.com/apis/storage/docs/gspythonlibrary.html)\>
is getting the boto library properly configured. Once it is set up, you
should be able to run all of the sample code provided by Google. Lets
get you there.

#### The Problem:

    #Bring in the boto library
    import boto
    #Load the configuration variables from your .boto file
    config = boto.config
    """
    FAIL.
    """"

As you can see by my fail note, App Engine has no way to access your
\~/.boto file where your Secret Key is located. We can solve this by
diving into boto.config. When the boto configuration is initialized, It
checks for the initial file and tries to parse it and load it into
memory by using "**add\_section(section\_name)**" and
"**set(section\_name,key,value)**". Knowing this, you're able to call
those functions yourself after loading the boto lib and it runs
flawlessly. It only took a little bit of hacking around to find a
solution, but it works great for me. I'd love to hear your experience,
or how you got it rolling differently.

#### My Solution:

pay close attention to the 3 lines following *config = boto.config*

    """"
    Python App Engine + Google Storage.
    Based heavily from examples given by Google
    Instructions:
    just rip the boto lib from the gsutil project, drop it in your python 
    App Engine project.
