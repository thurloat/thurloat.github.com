      <p>I'll start out by saying that I'm a huge <a class="reference external" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> fan. I have been
working with it exclusively for testing during the last few months. However,
it has become common knowledge that Jasmine's built-in methods for testing async
code are pretty weak and make for either lots of boilerplate, or fragile tests.</p>
<p>Let's go on a journey together from a small greenfield test suite through to
a full(<em>er</em>) set of specs as the project grows. I will walk through how I came
to implement a jasmine test extension for simplifying asynchronous specs
which I believe is a more holistic approach than I've seen anywhere else.</p>
<p>The few key differences you should note about the final solution are that it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allows for fail-fast tests without breaking the <tt class="docutils literal">waitsFor</tt> callback when an
exception is thrown,</li>
<li>Provides a simple mechanism to wrap async methods so their exceptions are
caught and reported correctly,</li>
<li>Doesn't require any different syntax than a Jasminaut is used to (less
refactoring).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="affairs">

<p>I wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/2012/07/06/jasmine-swallowing-async-exceptions">post</a> a few months ago which, at the time, dealt with my

      <p>On a recent cross-continent programming expedition, I ran into an <strong>exceptionally</strong>
frustrating bug while writing tests using the <a class="reference external" href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> unit testing framework.
After coming up with a solution on my own, I scoured the web for additional insight
and only found one other mention of this bug ( <em>and have since lost it</em> ).
This reference proposed a solution very similar to mine.
The most disheartening aspect is that this bug is not necessarily a bug within
Jasmine but can only be worked around by following a specific code pattern
which I'll be describing later.</p>
<p>This bug took ... a <em>while</em> to track down. Such a long while in fact that most of the
time was spent detecting the bug in the first place. It manifested by causing
tests to pass. I'm not sure if you are aware, but one of the first rules of
good unit tests in my books is that they do <strong>not</strong> emit false positives. False
positives in a test suite usually indicates that your tests don't have good branch
coverage or they do not assert the correct behaviour - not that many of your
tests are naively written in a way which makes them pass no matter what kind of
junk you put between the <tt class="docutils literal">{}</tt> in an asynchronous callback.</p>
<div class="section" id="steps-to-reproduce">
<h2>Steps To Reproduce</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Write some tests examining some asynchronous behaviour.</li>
<li>Expect something reasonable.</li>
<li>Write something that will throw an exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Outcome: All tests pass and you believe that you write bug-free code.</p>

      <p>Recently I've been spending time writing a REST API using a new stack.
Java AppEngine + Objectify using Jersey to build the API, and Jackson to
handle (de)serialization into/out of JSON. Needless to say I was running
into <strong>many</strong> problems that just don't come up in the Python world.</p>
<p>There was one problem that our team recently ran into that I thought I'd
share, as it took a long time to find the correct solution and there was
a lack of help online in this area.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Reading and writing polymorphic data types using Jackson.
For example a <tt class="docutils literal">List&lt;Key&lt;Entity&gt;&gt;</tt> at runtime can only be recognized as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">List&lt;?&gt;</span></tt> due to Type Erasure with Generics so Jackson can really only
try to serialize and deserialize that List as a list of POJOs. We already
have a serializer that writes out the Long value of a Key as <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot;</tt>.</p>
<p>However Jackson has no idea how to turn <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot;</tt> back into a List of
Entity Keys and complains with something along the lines of &quot;<em>Jackson
doesn't know how to turn type List&lt;Integer&gt; into List&lt;Key&lt;Entity&gt;</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>There are other documented solutions to this problem that didn't fit.
The most common was to embed type metadata into the JSON and then tell Jackson
about it using configuration. However after looking at the JSON users would
have to POST to the API, this was obviously a no-start.</p>

      <p>After more work with Backbone on projects at <a class="reference external" href="http://sheepdoginc.ca">Sheepdog</a>, we are starting
to develop a solid foundation that will allow us to easily develop,
<strong>test</strong>, and maintain our Backbone.js applications. Having these properties in
our JS / CoffeeScript is very important, as we're striving toward better test
coverage from server to client in order to best deliver the highest quality
product to our clients.</p>
<p>The approach that I'm taking to solve our problem is a simple implementation
of two common design patterns found in MVP applications. The Observer Pattern,
and the Factory Pattern.</p>
<div class="section" id="i-observer">
<h2>I, Observer</h2>
<p>Obtaining much of my MVP knowledge from one of our products written in GWT
(<a class="reference external" href="http://gtraxapp.com/">gTrax</a>) using the awesome GWT-Presenter and EventBus
libraries, it's been ingrained into my being that all independant pieces of
the application should  communicate exclusively over an agreed-upon API.
Rather than touting the benefits of modular code, I'll assume that since you're
still reading this you understand.</p>
<p>EventBus helps consolidate communication while developing in java and GWT,
and I didn't have to look far to find a flexible solution already available.
Backbone already mixes in the <strong>Backbone.Events</strong> class into all core pieces
of the framework so it's the perfect candidate (<em>shaving a yak, and all that</em>).
While I've seen this pattern implemented a few times, at <a class="reference external" href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/07/19/references-routing-and-the-event-aggregator-coordinating-views-in-backbone-js/">Los Techies</a> most
notably, it has been missing a key piece of the puzzle. Either people are

      <p>I'm doing a lot of experimenting with Backbone.js for the team at
Sheepdog these days. We're working on compiling a front end stack to build
our internal and client projects that require complex front end
interactions.</p>
<p>One of our &quot;wants&quot; for Backbone is to easily bind a Backbone.View containing
many form elements directly to a Backbone.Model instance. I wanted to implement
this in the most declarative way possible, similar to the way a view is
structured. The solution involved creating a subclass of Backbone.View called
FormView.</p>
<p>Before I start, I'd just like to show an example of the git diff stat from the
commit where I changed one of our View implementations to use FormView. They
say that you can calculate the value of your work by the lines of code that it
shrinks while maintaining functionality.</p>

<p>The new Bulkloader data exporter is much easier and more automated than
the nasty old
way of exporting. As good as it is, there were a lot of additional
requirements for one export script that I was tasked to write which
looked beyond the scope of the Bulkloader YAML configuration file.
Through reading the documentation and diving into the
I was able to find some creative solutions and for the most part -- keep
using the YAML file.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-long-and-winding-road">
<h2>The long and winding road</h2>
<p>I'm going to go through the problems I faced, and how I was able to
solve them using primarily the YAML config file with the new Bulkloader.</p>
<div class="section" id="csv-is-out-pipe-separated-is-in">
<h3>CSV is out, Pipe separated is in</h3>
<p>One of the requirements of the exported data was that it wasn't
comma-separated. It needed to be delimited by a <em>pipe</em>, &quot;<strong>|</strong>&quot;,
character. The options for exporting data via the Bulkloader are <em>CSV</em>,
<em>simpletext</em> and <em>xml</em>. I don't see &quot;<em>PSV</em>&quot; as an option.</p>

additional arguments by proxy to the Python CSV module. The outcome was
a nice clean pipe separated data format. This was <em>much</em>, <em>much</em> better
than the original thought: to try and use the Python module after the
CSV connector generated the file to re-write the CSV as pipe separated.</p>

<p>I love the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/">Google Closure</a>
project. As a big fan of its compiler and the linter, I use both
regularly at work and for my personal projects. However, it is not
without its flaws. The biggest hurtle to integrating the Closure Linter
into my workflow: it's strictly a command line tool. I have nothing against using
the terminal but, the workflow for running the linter over my JS looks
like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some changes to the JS file.</li>
<li>Open the terminal, run <tt class="docutils literal">gsjlint source.js</tt></li>
<li>Look over the results (<cite>ugly terminal output</cite>).</li>
<li>Jump back to the Editor, and find where the problems were.</li>
<li>go to 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This tedium quickly became frustrating. I wanted a more automated
approach to running the Closure Linter; so I hacked together a TextMate Bundle
to make all of our lives a little easier. I was able to integrate the linter into
my TextMate workflow without a hitch. Thus, here's my new workflow:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some changes to the JS file.</li>
<li>Hit &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">Shift + Ctl + Opt + A</tt>&quot;, results appear in a TextMate Browser
window, next to the code.</li>
<li>Keep making changes, and using keyboard shortcut to update the
linter window.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a screenshot of this new workflow in action:</p>
<img alt="Closure Linter Workflow" class="align-center" src="http://thurloat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ClosureLinter-1024x672.jpg" style="width: 625px;" />
<p><em>Pretty neat</em>! However, some of the changes that the Closure Linter wants
you to make are monotonous. I don't want to waste time putting a space
before my <tt class="docutils literal">=</tt> sign, or converting double quotes <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt> to single quotes <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt>.

<h2>The Potatoes</h2>
<p>Peer code review has become one of my favorite feedback processes by
far. At the SheepDog office, we're forming the habit of reviewing any
code that comes out of a sprint. In order to move a task from tested to
verified, it must get signed off by an engineer who did not write
the code. This process was quickly becoming cumbersome when done manually.
For example; A large feature would be created, then tested, and no one had the
time to look it over because the review process was: check out the source code
at the correct location, comb through it, and provide manual feedback to
the other developer -- had it not slipped your mind to review it in the
first place.</p>
<p>We installed the code review tool Rietveld on our production domain this week.
Getting it installed on our domain was incredibly easy; however it's not the
easiest option to find. <em>PROTIP</em>: Once you're in the Google Apps Domain Control
Panel, click <tt class="docutils literal">Add Services</tt>, Then you'll see this little link at the bottom
where you can install it..</p>
<img alt="Domain Labs" src="http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/thurloat/domainlabs.png" />
<p>Once inside, you can install the application as you would any other to
the domain. Of the many cool features, one of the things we quickly fell
in love with was the ability to leave a review without touching the
mouse. This made reviewing code much easier and seemingly familiar with
vi-ish key bindings; for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">j</tt> next diff,</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">k</tt> previous diff,</li>

      <p>I am pleased to announce <a class="reference external" href="http://gistrss.appspot.com/">GistRSS</a>
(a.k.a &quot;Pretty GitHub Gist RSS Feed App&quot;) to the world. The idea for this
application came about after a frustrating conversation with a friend of mine.
The problem that we exposed was that GitHub currently has mediocre
Gist atom feeds. GistRSS will allow you to subscribe to any GitHubber's
Gist feed and their Gist content will be sent straight to your RSS
Reader fully syntax highlighed.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-history">
<h2>The History</h2>
<p>After scouring the internet for some great tech RSS feeds, and bugging
my friends for help, Erik Kastner came to the rescue with an idea to get
fresh content into my RSS Reader.</p>

      <p>I've been using <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/storage/">Google Storage</a>
since I/O 2010, and I'm impressed with it so far. At <a class="reference external" href="http://sheepdoginc.ca">work</a>,
we've converted some of our application resources from using S3 as a CDN to
Google Storage this past week.</p>
<p>Being early adopters has its downfalls for sure; some of which usually
include system instability, a lack of published tools, and proper or
extensive documentation. I'll try to help address the latter in this
short tutorial.</p>

<h2>Configuring Google Storage for App Engine</h2>
<p>This problem has come up a couple of times in the Google Storage for Developers
group. After looking at the
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/storage/docs/gspythonlibrary.html">Python Library Docs for GS</a>,
the biggest hurdle looks like getting the boto library properly configured.
Once boto is set up, you should be able to run all of the sample code provided by
Google. <em>Lets get you there</em>.</p>

      <p>I've been a little behind on my photography posts, but I have not been
behind on expanding my horizons and taking all kinds of crazy pictures;
most of which will not end up around here. However, for Christmas Dad
got me a flash for our camera. He miraculously did this through leaving
it in his old SLR camera bag (<em>big thanks Dad!</em>) I've had a heck of a
time trying to get it working the right way with the much newer Canon
camera.</p>
<p>Just a warning to digital camera owners</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Careful with old flash vs new camera voltages. They could blow the hot
seat off your camera if you're not. So do your research in advance to
make sure that it's safe with your camera.&quot;</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Mr. Ian Munroe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So after about 5 days of toying, learning that the auto settings on the
old flash won't communicate with newer cameras, and trying desperately
to search online for the manual, I decided to take my own way out and
through caution to the wind. I spent a while toying with the shutter
speed, aperture and ISO to try and stop the insane hot spots the flash
was giving me. I ended up using something along the lines of 100ISO,
1/500, F16. This worked fine for the direct shots, but I'm finding the
flash is more useful when I point it somewhere else**....** I really
enjoy finding new ways to shoot the same shot, give it ...</p>

<h2>Drug Charges</h2>
<blockquote>
<em>December 9, 2009</em> <strong>Drug Search Results in Charges</strong> Four men and one
woman face charges after a drug search last night in Fairview by the
HRP/RCMP Integrated Drug Unit assisted by the Quick Response Unit. A
search of a residence in the 0-100 block of Dawn Street resulted in
the seizure of a quantity of marijuana, cocaine, hash and other drug
paraphernalia. A handgun magazine containing bullets was also seized.
Five people were arrested at the scene without incident. Stephen
Andrew Coleman, 21, of Dartmouth, is charged with drug trafficking and
weapons related offences. He was also wanted on a parole warrant. Shea
Alexander Durnford, 21, of Halifax, is charged with drug trafficking
and also had an outstanding parole warrant. Ryan William Ross, 20, of
Dartmouth, Ashley Rose MacNeil, 23, and Eric Thomas Whickens, 53, both
of Halifax face charges of drug trafficking. Coleman, Durnford, Ross
and MacNeil were all held for court today while Whickens was released
but also scheduled to appear in court today.</blockquote>

      <p>On a regular basis I find myself looking at something and thinking
&quot;damnit, I wish i could keep this&quot;... often times what I'm seeing in my
head isn't really what would be captured on film, my imagination is
often much less literal. That has been one of Photography's biggest
turn-offs for me in the past and hopefully this is where capturing and
editing skills from a few of my friends will keep me motivated!</p>
<p>In my Photography &amp; Lightroom corner, I have
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.ianmunroe.com">Ian Munroe</a>. Ian is doing a lot of over time
getting my technical photography skills up to par. Anything from
helping to fix my over-zealous white balance settings, to being my
personal Wikipedia for technical knowledge, he's been right there.
He's also helping to keep me inspired with constant feedback on what
I've placed in his DropBox, and donating tips (hard learned, I'm
sure.) on using Lightroom to put some finishing touches on my photos.

have. I'm especially keen on learning editing techniques that will

      <p>Earlier this week I was presented with the opportunity to write a blog
post / case study for the Google App Engine Blog about how I leveraged
App Engine while developing the Canoe '09 results application. How could
I refuse such an honor? Well, I couldn't. So after some careful edits
from the guys over at Google, and the folks here at the Norex office, we
came up with an interesting piece about the Agility, Reliability and
Stability that we saw during the course of the event. True Story!</p>
<div class="section" id="preview">
<h2>Preview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>... we saw over 1,000,000 page views from 93 countries around the
world, and experienced incredible stability and scalability from
Google App Engine even when we were spiking 350 requests per second
during the finals. It was a big win for Norex, and App Engine has
proven itself to be a serious contender for developing scalable web
applications. Thanks so much to the Google App Engine team for
providing such an outstanding product!</p>

      <p>This is my iPhone tethering story. With the cable down and no where else
to turn I looked to my trusty swiss-army knife of utilities: My
iPhone... did it pass or fail? Well, before I tell my Saturday evening
Internet story, I'll preface with the fact that I'm upset that Rogers
isn't including Internet tethering unto us lowly 500MB/month folks.
Seriously, what's up with that? They can't be worried about me going
over my data limit, as that would just make them more money!</p>
<div class="section" id="the-story">
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>The cable seemed to be out in the apartment this evening, so I decided
what better time than now to get tethering work on my phone. This was
not a huge feat of wizardry, it is quite well documented throughout
the web. After that went smoothly, I just plugged it in. I'm writing
this post on my new fan-dangled tethering device, and the connection is
wonderfully persistent (so far). I'll be Frank, Frank is surprised how
easily and wonderfully easy (<em>did he mention that it was easy?</em>) it was
to get running. One thing Frank noticed is that iTunes appears to be
taking <em>~%12-18 CPU</em> to keep the connection going, which he figured was
just because iTunes was pulling double duty as an emergency Internet
connection, and frankly, Frank was okay with that. Frank also enjoyed the
browsing speed. He immediately noticed that pages were a lot snappier on
his laptop as opposed to his phone ...</p></div>

<div class="section" id="results">
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Whether or not anyone has heard, my father passed away from complications
with chemotherapy on July 3rd, 2010. Sparing all of the emotional outcry,
it's thrown a wrench into my plans and put me out of commission for a
week or two. I won't say that I haven't made ANY progress, as a couple
goals are in the double digit completion range. Here's the breakdown.</p>
<div class="section" id="contribute-something-good-to-an-open-source-project">
<h3>Contribute something good to an Open Source project</h3>

some proof of concept iMDB apps, but the ball IS rolling.</p>

<h3>Break the 100 Twitter Followers barrier (real 125)</h3>

      <p>I had a good chat with Jessica the other day about my work load, the
things I say I will do, things promise I will do, priorities, and life
decisions. She always gets me into a thought provoking mood. It turns out
that I have made it a habit for myself to tell everyone <strong>YES</strong>! to
whatever they're asking ... then attempt to cram it into my schedule.
It's been pointed out to me that if I somehow don't get these things fit
into my schedule... I appear un-reliable. eek. So there are 2 action
items that I've decided I <strong>NEED</strong> to take. I need to start telling
people that I'm busy, and I need to come up with some clear goals that I
am going to work on. So I've decided that in order to build
motivation I need a list! I've always been inspired by
<a class="reference external" href="http://metaatem.net/">Erik Kastner's Blog</a> posts about his goals and I think
that writing them down and making it permanent will help make it happen.

      <p>So, here I was (you are here). Sitting on the couch, leisurely watching
“John and Kate plus 8”. When I looked over at Jessica’s Psychology Quiz.
This text is quoted straight from an University Psych textbook... seriously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Captain Picard leaves Deep Space Nine at 0900 hours and travels at
Warp 4 his shuttlecraft, he can rendezvous with the Starship
Enterprise in 4. 2 hours. However, in order to reach the ship so
quickly, he would have to travel through the Neutral Zone, and his
presence would undoubtedly be noticed by Romulan warships, which would
attack and destroy his craft. Thus, Picard realizes that he will have
to take another route to the ship and thus devises what comes to be
known as the “Picard loop” to get around the neutral zone. The Captain
has applied ____.</p>

      <p>I just got my mitts on Google Chrome for Mac. The JS speed is
incredible.</p>

<p>There is actually a visually noticeable speed difference when using our
Framework back-end.
I might just start using it for adminning sites / content entry
because it doesn’t ever bog down on the heavy JS activity with Chunk
revisions. It just seems to be more snappy in general compared to FF
3.01, where, on many occasions FF will freeze for 1/4 of a second when
it’s processing JS or finishing a page load. It creates a frustration
inside of me so deep and burning ...</p>
<p>Seriously. It’s only quarter of a second, but if I had all of those
quarter seconds back, I’d for sure have at least a minute on my hands.</p>
<p>P.S. i just noticed that half of the toolbar for making tumblr posts has
disappeared in chrome.. weird.</p>
