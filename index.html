<p>The new Bulkloader data exporter is much easier and more automated than
the nasty old
way of exporting. As good as it is, there were a lot of additional
requirements for one export script that I was tasked to write which
looked beyond the scope of the Bulkloader YAML configuration file.
Through reading the documentation and diving into the
I was able to find some creative solutions and for the most part -- keep
using the YAML file.</p>

<p>I love the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/">Google Closure</a>
project. As a big fan of its compiler and the linter, I use both
regularly at work and for my personal projects. However, it is not
without its flaws. The biggest hurtle to integrating the Closure Linter
into my workflow: it's strictly a command line tool. I have nothing against using
the terminal but, the workflow for running the linter over my JS looks
like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some changes to the JS file.</li>

<h2>The Potatoes</h2>
<p>Peer code review has become one of my favorite feedback processes by
far. At the SheepDog office, we're forming the habit of reviewing any
code that comes out of a sprint. In order to move a task from tested to
verified, it must get signed off by an engineer who did not write
the code. This process was quickly becoming cumbersome when done manually.
For example; A large feature would be created, then tested, and no one had the
time to look it over because the review process was: check out the source code

                    <p>It's about that time that I come out and see how my planned goals are
coming. I hate making excuses for not doing things, and it hurts me to
do so. So here's a long list of excuses.</p>

<p>Whether or not anyone has heard, my father passed away from complications
with chemotherapy on July 3rd, 2010. Sparing all of the emotional outcry,
it's thrown a wrench into my plans and put me out of commission for a
week or two. I won't say that I haven't made ANY progress, as a couple
goals are ...</p></div>

                    <p>I took a day off from going to the hospital and visiting my Dad. As much
as we love to be there with him, we there are other people's needs that
need met. While working today I was slowly writing down my thoughts
about the current events and it turned into a letter. I think that the
best way for me to keep on top is to share how I'm feeling, and I'm
feeling like hell... So as you might imagine, this is very emotional and
probably sounds like a bunch of rambling, but either way.</p>

                    <p>I had a good chat with Jessica the other day about my work load, the
things I say I will do, things promise I will do, priorities, and life
decisions. She always gets me into a thought provoking mood. It turns out
that I have made it a habit for myself to tell everyone <strong>YES</strong>! to
whatever they're asking ... then attempt to cram it into my schedule.
It's been pointed out to me that if I somehow don't get these things fit
into my schedule... I appear un-reliable. eek. So there are 2 action
items that I ...</p>

“John and Kate plus 8”. When I looked over at Jessica’s Psychology Quiz.
This text is quoted straight from an University Psych textbook... seriously.</p>

<p>If Captain Picard leaves Deep Space Nine at 0900 hours and travels at
Warp 4 his shuttlecraft, he can rendezvous with the Starship
Enterprise in 4. 2 hours. However, in order to reach the ship so
quickly, he would have to travel through the Neutral Zone, and his
presence would undoubtedly be noticed by Romulan warships, which would
attack and destroy his ...</p></blockquote>

incredible.</p>

<p>There is actually a visually noticeable speed difference when using our
Framework back-end.
I might just start using it for adminning sites / content entry
because it doesn’t ever bog down on the heavy JS activity with Chunk
revisions. It just seems to be more snappy in general compared to FF
3.01, where, on many occasions FF will freeze for 1/4 of a second when
it’s processing JS or finishing a page load. It creates a frustration
inside of me so deep ...</p>
