                    <p>The new Bulkloader data exporter is much easier and more automated than
the nasty old
way of exporting. As good as it is, there were a lot of additional
requirements for one export script that I was tasked to write which
looked beyond the scope of the Bulkloader YAML configuration file.
Through reading the documentation and diving into the
I was able to find some creative solutions and for the most part -- keep
using the YAML file.</p>

<p>I love the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/">Google Closure</a>
project. As a big fan of its compiler and the linter, I use both
regularly at work and for my personal projects. However, it is not
without its flaws. The biggest hurtle to integrating the Closure Linter
into my workflow: it's strictly a command line tool. I have nothing against using
the terminal but, the workflow for running the linter over my JS looks
like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some changes to the JS file.</li>
<li>Open the terminal, run <tt class="docutils literal">gsjlint source.js</tt></li>
<li>Look over the results (<cite>ugly terminal output</cite>).</li>
<li>Jump back to the Editor, and find ...</li></ol>

<h2>The Potatoes</h2>
<p>Peer code review has become one of my favorite feedback processes by
far. At the SheepDog office, we're forming the habit of reviewing any
code that comes out of a sprint. In order to move a task from tested to
verified, it must get signed off by an engineer who did not write
the code. This process was quickly becoming cumbersome when done manually.
For example; A large feature would be created, then tested, and no one had the
time to look it over because the review process was: check out the source code
at the correct ...</p></div>

(a.k.a &quot;Pretty GitHub Gist RSS Feed App&quot;) to the world. The idea for this
application came about after a frustrating conversation with a friend of mine.
The problem that we exposed was that GitHub currently has mediocre
Gist atom feeds. GistRSS will allow you to subscribe to any GitHubber's
Gist feed and their Gist content will be sent straight to your RSS
Reader fully syntax highlighed.</p>
