to develop a solid foundation that will allow us to easily develop,

our JS / CoffeeScript is very important, as we're striving toward better test
coverage from server to client in order to best deliver the highest quality
product to our clients.</p>
<p>The approach that I'm taking to solve our problem is a simple implementation
of two common design patterns found in MVP applications. The Observer Pattern,
and the Factory Pattern.</p>

Sheepdog these days. We're working on compiling a front end stack to build
our internal and client projects that require complex front end
interactions.</p>
<p>One of our &quot;wants&quot; for Backbone is to easily bind a Backbone.View containing
many form elements directly to a Backbone.Model instance. I wanted to implement
this in the most declarative way possible, similar to the way a view is
structured. The solution involved creating a subclass of Backbone.View called
FormView.</p>

<p>The new Bulkloader data exporter is much easier and more automated than
the nasty old
way of exporting. As good as it is, there were a lot of additional
requirements for one export script that I was tasked to write which
looked beyond the scope of the Bulkloader YAML configuration file.
Through reading the documentation and diving into the
I was able to find some creative solutions and for the most part -- keep
using the YAML file.</p>

<p>I love the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/closure/utilities/">Google Closure</a>
project. As a big fan of its compiler and the linter, I use both
regularly at work and for my personal projects. However, it is not
without its flaws. The biggest hurtle to integrating the Closure Linter
into my workflow: it's strictly a command line tool. I have nothing against using
the terminal but, the workflow for running the linter over my JS looks
like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make some changes to the JS file.</li>

<h2>The Potatoes</h2>
<p>Peer code review has become one of my favorite feedback processes by
far. At the SheepDog office, we're forming the habit of reviewing any
code that comes out of a sprint. In order to move a task from tested to
verified, it must get signed off by an engineer who did not write
the code. This process was quickly becoming cumbersome when done manually.
For example; A large feature would be created, then tested, and no one had the
time to look it over because the review process was: check out the source code

                    <p>On a regular basis I find myself looking at something and thinking
&quot;damnit, I wish i could keep this&quot;... often times what I'm seeing in my
head isn't really what would be captured on film, my imagination is
often much less literal. That has been one of Photography's biggest
turn-offs for me in the past and hopefully this is where capturing and
editing skills from a few of my friends will keep me motivated!</p>

                    <p>Earlier this week I was presented with the opportunity to write a blog
post / case study for the Google App Engine Blog about how I leveraged
App Engine while developing the Canoe '09 results application. How could
I refuse such an honor? Well, I couldn't. So after some careful edits
from the guys over at Google, and the folks here at the Norex office, we
came up with an interesting piece about the Agility, Reliability and
Stability that we saw during the course of the event. True Story!</p>

to turn I looked to my trusty swiss-army knife of utilities: My

Internet story, I'll preface with the fact that I'm upset that Rogers
isn't including Internet tethering unto us lowly 500MB/month folks.
Seriously, what's up with that? They can't be worried about me going
over my data limit, as that would just make them more money!</p>

need met. While working today I was slowly writing down my thoughts
about the current events and it turned into a letter. I think that the
best way for me to keep on top is to share how I'm feeling, and I'm
feeling like hell... So as you might imagine, this is very emotional and
probably sounds like a bunch of rambling, but either way.</p>

<p>There is actually a visually noticeable speed difference when using our
Framework back-end.
I might just start using it for adminning sites / content entry
because it doesn’t ever bog down on the heavy JS activity with Chunk
revisions. It just seems to be more snappy in general compared to FF
3.01, where, on many occasions FF will freeze for 1/4 of a second when
it’s processing JS or finishing a page load. It creates a frustration
